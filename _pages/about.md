During weekdays, I work as a Data Analyst, but weekends find me in my element as an educator. With over 1.5 years of teaching experience as a Teaching Assistant at the `Indian Institute of Technology Madras` and `Indian Institute of Technology Ropar`, I've discovered that teaching others to see patterns in data is just as rewarding as uncovering those insights myself. I feel very strongly about open access to educational resources.

I recently completed the minimum credit requirement for my `Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Applications with a minor in Economics & Finance` from IIT-Madras, alongside a `Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in AI-ML` from Delhi Technological University. This interdisciplinary foundation has naturally drawn me towards `Quantitative Finance` and `Data Science for Social Sciences` (Digital Humanities) ‚Äî areas where data meets human behavior and societal impact.

My research experiences have taken me from digitizing historical League of Nations proceedings in Paris under the `France Excellence Charpak Lab Scholarship` to enhancing systematic literature review tools in Montreal through the `MITACS Globalink Research Internship`. I'm driven by the potential of data science to make complex systems more interpretable and accessible. Also, I enjoy cooking and have a keen interest in geo-politics.
