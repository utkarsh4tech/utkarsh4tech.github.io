Building on the foundations of the first course, Mathematics for Data Science II delved into the core mathematical machinery that powers machine learning. The course was a deep exploration of linear algebra, starting with vectors and matrices and progressing through vector spaces, bases, and linear transformations. I gained a strong understanding of concepts like orthogonality and the Gram-Schmidt process. The second half of the course transitioned to multivariable calculus, which was crucial for understanding optimization. We covered partial derivatives, gradients, and the Hessian matrix, learning how to find critical points and local extrema for multivariable functionsâ€”skills that are directly applicable to training machine learning models.
