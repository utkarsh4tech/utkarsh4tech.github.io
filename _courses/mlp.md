This course was the essential practical companion to the machine learning theory courses, focusing on implementation and real-world problem-solving. Using Python and the popular `scikit-learn` library, we learned how to execute an end-to-end machine learning project. The curriculum provided hands-on experience for a wide range of algorithms, including implementing linear, polynomial, and logistic regression, building binary and multiclass classifiers, and deploying advanced models like Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and basic Neural Networks. The course emphasized not just the "how" but also the "how-to" of applying machine learning in practice.
