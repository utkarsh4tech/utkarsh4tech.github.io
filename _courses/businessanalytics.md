This course was designed to build the critical skill of creating quantitative models to solve complex business problems. The core focus was on the practical application of statistical methods, moving beyond theory to demonstrate how these techniques can lead to better decisions and insights. We covered a wide array of topics, starting with data visualization and distribution fitting, and progressing to predictive modeling with simple, multiple, and logistic regression. The course also introduced advanced analytical frameworks like optimization for profit maximization, Data Envelopment Analysis for efficiency measurement, and Conjoint Analysis for understanding customer preferences.
