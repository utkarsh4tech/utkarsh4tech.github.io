Statistics for Data Science II, was a deep dive into the practical engine of statistical inference. We went beyond basic probability and learned how to model the real world by working with multiple random variables, understanding their dependencies through covariance and correlation. My biggest takeaway was learning how to formally draw conclusions from data; I'm now comfortable with two major approaches for this â€” estimating unknown values using both frequentist (like MLE) and Bayesian methods, and then validating claims through rigorous hypothesis testing.
