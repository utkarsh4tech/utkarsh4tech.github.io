This course provided a rigorous introduction to the theory and application of linear statistical models, a cornerstone of modern data analysis. After a review of statistical inference and the R programming language, we delved into the core of linear models. I learned the principles of least squares estimation, the properties of Best Linear Unbiased Estimates (BLUEs), and the significance of the Gauss-Markov Theorem. The course balanced this strong theoretical foundation with practical applications, teaching me how to perform hypothesis testing and build one-way and two-way classification models, including ANOVA and ANCOVA, using R.
