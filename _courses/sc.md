This course was a deep dive into the power of the command line, designed to move beyond graphical interfaces and interact directly with the operating system. We started with the fundamentals of the Linux environment, learning to diagnose hardware and software configurations. The curriculum progressed through essential skills like package management, file permissions, and I/O redirection. We then learned to combine these commands into powerful shell scripts, automate tasks, and perform advanced text processing with tools like `awk` and `sed`. The course concluded with an essential skill for any developer: version control using Git, covering everything from local repositories to collaborative workflows with pull requests.
