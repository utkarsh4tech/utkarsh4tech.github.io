Managerial Economics provided a practical framework for applying microeconomic principles to real-world business decisions. The course began with the fundamentals of supply, demand, and consumer behavior, before moving into the analysis of production, technology, and costs from a firm's perspective. A major part of the course was a detailed examination of various market structures, from perfect competition to monopoly and monopolistic competition. This theoretical knowledge was then applied to complex managerial challenges, including making decisions under uncertainty, dealing with asymmetric information, navigating government regulations, and understanding the unique economics of modern platform businesses.
