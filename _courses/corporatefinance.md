This course provided a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of finance. We started with the core concept of the time value of money, learning to value annuities and perpetuities, which formed the basis for capital budgeting decisions. The curriculum then introduced risk and reward, leading into modern portfolio theory and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for pricing assets. We also explored market efficiency, the basics of derivative securities like options, and the broader context of international finance and financial crises, equipping me with a robust toolkit for financial analysis.
