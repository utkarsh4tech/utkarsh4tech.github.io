Statistics for Data Science I provided the fundamental building blocks for understanding and interpreting data. The course introduced me to the complete data analysis pipeline, starting from identifying different types of data and their measurement scales. I learned to summarize and visualize both categorical and numerical data using various descriptive statistics and graphical methods. A significant portion of the course was dedicated to building a strong foundation in probability theory, from basic counting principles to conditional probability and Bayes' theorem, which paved the way for understanding and working with random variables and their distributions.
