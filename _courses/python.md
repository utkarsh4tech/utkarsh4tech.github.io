As the first formal programming course in the curriculum, this was a comprehensive introduction to Python with an emphasis on algorithmic thinking. The course was designed to build programming skills from the ground up. We started with the basics of algorithms and control flow, including conditionals and loops. A significant portion of the course was dedicated to mastering Python's core data collectionsâ€”lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. We then moved on to practical skills like file operations and understanding Python's module system, concluding with an introduction to the powerful Pandas and Numpy libraries, which are essential for data science.
