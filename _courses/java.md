This course used the Java language to provide a deep understanding of several core programming paradigms. It began with a thorough exploration of Object-Oriented Programming, covering class hierarchies, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes in detail. We then moved to essential Java features like the Collections framework, generics, I/O serialization, and robust exception handling. A significant portion of the course was dedicated to concurrent programming, providing the critical skills needed to build multi-threaded and responsive applications, a key requirement in modern software development.

## Course Schedule & Topics

The course is structured over 12 weeks, focusing on OOP principles before moving to advanced topics like concurrency.

| Week   | Primary Focus                 | Key Topics Covered                                                                                 |
| :----- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | OOP: Class Hierarchy          | Understanding the basics of classes, objects, and how they form hierarchies.                       |
| **2**  | OOP: Inheritance & Overriding | Implementing inheritance to create specialized classes and overriding methods for custom behavior. |
| **3**  | OOP: Polymorphism             | Leveraging polymorphism to write more flexible and reusable code.                                  |
| **4**  | OOP: Abstract Classes         | Defining abstract classes and methods to create templates for subclasses.                          |
| **5**  | Collections & Iterators       | Working with Java's built-in data structures and using iterators to traverse them.                 |
| **6**  | Generics & Callbacks          | Implementing type-safe collections with Generics and understanding the callback pattern.           |
| **7**  | Advanced Java Features I      | Object cloning, I/O serializations for object persistence, and organizing code with Packages.      |
| **8**  | Advanced Java Features II     | Continued practice and deeper dive into cloning, I/O, and packages.                                |
| **9**  | Exception Handling            | Techniques for building robust applications by handling runtime errors and exceptions.             |
| **10** | Concurrent Programming I      | Introduction to multi-threaded programming and concurrency fundamentals.                           |
| **11** | Concurrent Programming II     | Intermediate concepts and patterns in concurrent programming.                                      |
| **12** | Concurrent Programming III    | Advanced topics and practices for building robust concurrent applications.                         |
