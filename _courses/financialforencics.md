This course provided a unique blend of traditional accounting and modern data science to uncover financial fraud. We began with the fundamentals of financial statements and common fraud vulnerabilities. The curriculum then introduced the formal role and process of forensic accounting, including practical, hands-on techniques like applying Benford's Law, aging analysis, and outlier detection in Excel. The second half of the course shifted to a high-tech approach, exploring how AI/ML is used in the financial transaction lifecycle, and delving into supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection models to identify suspicious activities. The course culminated in learning how to visualize and explain these findings using Tableau.
