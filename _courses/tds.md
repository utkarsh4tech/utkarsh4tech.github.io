This course was a hands-on tour of the modern data science toolkit, covering the entire project lifecycle from conception to production. We explored a range of popular tools for each stage: sourcing data from various origins, preparing and cleaning it for analysis, and then uncovering insights. A key focus was on communicating these findings effectively through compelling data visualizations. The course also covered the engineering aspects of data science, including the tools used for developing models and applications, deploying them into production environments, and leveraging Large Language Models to make our work more efficient and our applications smarter.
