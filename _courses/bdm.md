This course was designed to bridge the gap between data science and practical business application. It began by establishing a strong foundation in the micro-economic principles that govern business operations, from consumer demand to firm-level strategy and industry analysis. The core of the course was a series of immersive, data-driven case studies that spanned major industries: E-Commerce (Fabmart), Manufacturing (Ace Gears), IT/HR (Tech Enterprises), and FinTech (PayBuddy). Through these cases, I learned how to analyze real-world business data to tackle challenges in sales forecasting, inventory management, production scheduling, HR analytics, and targeted marketing using A/B testing.
