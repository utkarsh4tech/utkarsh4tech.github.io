This course provided a comprehensive, end-to-end overview of building modern web applications. Through an evolving case study, we explored the entire development stack. The journey began with web fundamentals and building the presentation layer with HTML and CSS. We then delved into the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, learning to manage the data layer with databases (Models), implement business logic (Controllers), and structure the front-end (Views). The curriculum also covered crucial components like creating and consuming REST APIs, ensuring application security, writing tests, and finally, deploying a complete web application.
