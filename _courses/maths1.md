Mathematics for Data Science I was an essential course that built the abstract reasoning and problem-solving toolkit required for data science. The course progressed logically from foundational concepts like set theory to the practical application of functions, including linear, quadratic, polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic forms. A key part of the course was a rigorous introduction to single-variable calculus, covering limits, derivatives, and integrals, which are crucial for optimization and understanding rates of change. Finally, the course transitioned into discrete mathematics with a comprehensive unit on graph theory, exploring everything from basic traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS to complex shortest path and minimum spanning tree problems.
