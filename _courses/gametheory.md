This course was a fascinating exploration of the science of strategic decision-making. We began by building a strong foundation in the core types of games, including those with simultaneous and sequential moves, and learned how to analyze them for equilibria. The course then expanded to a wide range of fascinating applications, from evolutionary game theory and the Gale-Shapley matching algorithm to the complexities of social choice and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. We also covered cooperative games, fair division problems, auction design, and the strategic implications of network effects, providing a comprehensive view of how to model and understand strategic interactions.
