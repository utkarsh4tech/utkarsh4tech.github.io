title: Data Structures & Algorithms
description: "An in-depth course on fundamental data structures and algorithms from Coursera."
---

This course covered the essentials of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. We also implemented and analyzed various sorting and searching algorithms.

**Key Topics:**
- Big O Notation
- Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Hash Tables
- Tree Traversal

A final project involved solving a real-world problem using an efficient algorithm. You can view the project [here](https://github.com/your-repo).
