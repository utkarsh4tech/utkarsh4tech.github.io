This course offered a unique, hands-on approach to understanding the fundamentals of programming and algorithmic thinking. Instead of relying on a compiler, we learned to trace the execution of programs manually. This method provided deep insight into how a computer processes instructions. We covered a wide range of topics, starting with basic building blocks like variables and control flow, moving through essential data structures like lists, dictionaries, and graphs. The course concluded with advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming, recursion, and the challenges of concurrent and parallel programming, providing a complete mental model of computation.
