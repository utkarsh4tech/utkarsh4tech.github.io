As a direct continuation of the first course, Modern Application Development II dove deeper into the practical skills required for building sophisticated web applications. The course began with a solid foundation in both basic and advanced JavaScript, which is essential for modern front-end development. We then specialized in the Vue.js framework, learning to build reactive user interfaces and integrate them with back-end APIs. The curriculum also covered advanced architectural concepts, including state management, authentication, designing robust APIs, handling asynchronous jobs, and implementing inter-service messaging with webhooks. The course culminated in a final project that integrated all of these advanced skills.
