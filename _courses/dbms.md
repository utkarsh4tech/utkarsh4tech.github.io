This course provided a thorough grounding in the principles and practices of modern database management systems. Starting with the theoretical foundations of the relational model, we quickly moved into practical application with a deep dive into SQL, covering everything from basic queries to advanced topics. A key focus was on robust database design, for which we studied functional dependencies and normalization in detail. The course also covered the internal workings of a DBMS, including storage management, indexing, transaction processing, and query optimization, giving a complete end-to-end understanding of how databases function.
